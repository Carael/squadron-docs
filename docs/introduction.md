Squadron is a infrastructure framework which helps you to run tests against application dependent services. There are two concept on which Squadron is based:
1. Container Providers 
2. Cloud Providers

### 1. Container Proviers
This are providers for services which can run in a container. This offers full isloation on the build server or on local machine.

> Container Providers requieres Docker to be installed.

### 2. Cloud Providers
This are providers which abstracts any cloud service. A varaety of services which dosn't support containarization can be implemented as Cloud Provider.

### Getting Started

To get started, we have prepared examples for each service step by step.
