Squadron is a infrastructure framework which helps you to run tests against application dependent services. There are two concept on which Squadron is based:
1. Container Providers 
2. Cloud Providers

### 1. Container Providers
This are providers for services which can run in a container. This offers full isolation on the build server or on local machine.

> Container Providers requirers Docker to be installed.

### 2. Cloud Providers
This are providers which abstracts any cloud service. A variety of services which doesn't support containerization can be implemented as Cloud Provider.

> Always use a dedicated test resource.

## Getting Started

To get started, we have prepared examples for each service step by step.

## Basic Concept

To understand who this is working and what Squadron is doing "behind the scenes", we have prepared a short description of our framework.
